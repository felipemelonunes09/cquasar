# 💬 Description

This repository contains the code for the compiler of the C-Quasar programming language. It includes all the source code needed to build the compiler and execute programs on this platform. For testing, the code has been developed and run within a Docker container, with the Dockerfile included in the repository for those who wish to execute it in a similar environment.

## Why C ?

It was developed in C++ to achieve better performance and, more importantly, to deepen our understanding of the language and learn how compilers work. We chose C++ because it presents a challenging learning curve and requires disciplined practices to ensure efficient and reliable execution.
