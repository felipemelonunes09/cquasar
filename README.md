# 💬 Description

This repository contains the code for the compiler of the C-Quasar programming language. It includes all the source code needed to build the compiler and execute programs on this platform. For testing, the code has been developed and run within a Docker container, with the Dockerfile included in the repository for those who wish to execute it in a similar environment.

## Why C ?

It was developed in C++ to achieve better performance and, more importantly, to deepen our understanding of the language and learn how compilers work. We chose C++ because it presents a challenging learning curve and requires disciplined practices to ensure efficient and reliable execution.

# 🏆 Goals

Here are the goals that we want to achieve.

> | Status  | 📐 Regularização  |
> | ---| ---     |
> | ❌ | Fully Functioanble Programing Language    |
> | ❌ | Being a typed language    |
> | ❌ | Has Functions    |
> | ❌ | Working Garbage Collector    |
> | ❌ | Beeing Object Oriented    |


# 🏗️ Building
This code was builded using the following flags
```cpp
-std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -g
```
> But you can also use the Makefile using the command `make` on the current directory.
